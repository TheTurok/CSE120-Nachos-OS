Me and my partner worked together, we went through every part one step 
at a time. Sometime he or I would work at home and we would combine 
the codes we typed the following day and try to see what happens from
there.

It does work well but the times of our schedules conflict a lot which 
is a bummer when we need many hours to do this project.
We also wasted time trying to explain our parts to the other 
partner, whichs wasn't ideal but maybe still faster than solo as
two heads are better that one.
